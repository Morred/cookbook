Challah Bread

Ingredients

(Makes 1 really big or 2 normal sized loaves)

- 2 tsp dry yeast
- 250 ml lukewarm water
- 550 g flour
- 50 g white sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 large egg yolk (keep white for egg wash)
- 60 ml neutral vegetable oil

How To

Sprinkle yeast over water in a bowl, and add a healthy pinch of sugar. (If you're using instant yeast that doesn't need to be dissolved, just add the yeast to the dry ingredients and add the water separately as described).

Mix 500 g of the flour, sugar and salt (and the yeast if you're using instant yeast).

Make a depression in the center of the flour and add eggs, egg yolk and oil. Whisk them together to form a slurry, pulling in a little flour from the sides of the bowl.

Pour the yeast mixture (or just the water when using instant yeast) over the egg slurry. Mix the yeast, eggs, and flour with a spoon until you form a shaggy dough that is difficult to mix.

Put the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes. If the dough seems very sticky, add flour a teaspoon at a time until it feels tacky, but no longer like bubblegum. The dough has finished kneading when it is soft, smooth, holds a ball-shape and bounces back when you poke it.

Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and place somewhere warm. Let the dough rise until doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Separate the dough into three or six equal pieces, depending on the type of braid you'd like to do. Roll each piece of dough into a long rope roughly 1-inch thick and 16 inches long. If the ropes shrink as you try to roll them, let them rest for 5 minutes to relax the gluten and then try again.

Gather the ropes, squeeze them together at the very top and braid.

Line a baking sheet with parchment and lift the loaf on top. Sprinkle the loaf with a little flour and drape it with a clean dishcloth. Place the pan somewhere warm and away from drafts and let it rise until puffed and pillowy, about an hour.

About 20 minutes before baking, heat the oven to 180Â°C. When ready to bake, whisk the reserved egg white with a tablespoon of water and brush it all over the challah. Be sure to get in the cracks and down the sides of the loaf.

Slide the challah on its baking sheet into the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through cooking. The challah is done when it is deeply browned and sounds hollow when you tap the bottom.

Let the challah cool on a cooling rack until just barely warm.
