## German Apple Pie

### Ingredients:
(26 cm Springform)

**Dough:**

- 300 g flour
- 1/2 pack German baking powder
- 100 g sugar
- 1 pack German vanilla sugar
- 1 egg
- 175 g butter

**Filling:**

- 1.5 kg apples (pick a sort with a distinctive taste and a little tartness)
- 50 g sugar (or to taste)
- 1 pack German vanilla sugar
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon (or to taste)
- 50 g butter

### How To

Put flour in a big bowl, add baking powder, sugar and vanilla sugar. Mix well.  
Add egg and butter in little pieces. Knead together to form a dough.  
Wrap in plastic wrap and let sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes.  

Peel, core and chop apples. Lightly braise in a pot together with vanilla sugar, butter, sugar and cinnamon.  
Drain well and set aside to cool.  

Preheat oven to about 180Â°C. Lightly grease the springform pan with butter.  
Roll about 3/4 of the dough into round shape. Put into pan, make the rim about 4cm tall.  
Poke the bottom a couple of times with a fork to make holes (to avoid it bubbling up when baking).  
Prebake for about 12 minutes.  

Roll the rest of the dough into round shape to make the lid.  
Take pan out of the oven, fill with apple filling, put lid on top and carefully connect rim and lid.  
Continue baking at the same temperature for about 30-40 minutes.
